# About Me
IT professional with a creative streak. I have been fortunate enough to gain expertise in various operating systems, software, and hardware throughout my career, which began in 2009. My time in the field has also equipped me with excellent problem-solving and interpersonal skills, allowing me to work well with diverse technology and teams in high-pressure situations. My curiosity and love of learning and helping others make me a naturally motivated lifelong learner. I seek opportunities that will allow me to grow and utilize my skills so that I may have a positive influence on the organization and those around me. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from WGU, which I will finish by October 2025.

# Current Personal Projects
These are projects that I work on as time allows between family, work, and school obligations. My motivations for working on these projects include gaining experience with tech that interests me while hopefully giving something back to the free and open-source software community that has been an invaluable source of knowledge and inspiration for me.

## Homelab System and Network Administration Projects
- Windows Server and Desktop Administration Lab Using Type 2 Hypervisors
  - Built a Windows domain lab environment that allows me to gain experience deploying services common in Windows environments
    - Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, WDS, WSUS, NTFS Permissions, Network File Shares, Powershell
    - Using pfSense for switching, routing, isolating traffic between servers, clients, and external networks 

## Web Development Projects
- TLDP Dark (dark mode user style for The Linux Documentation Project)
  - This is a custom CSS stylesheet applied using the Stylus browser extension
  - I aim to publish the style to UserStyles.world for public use once I am satisfied with it.
- Paradigm Pet Professionals (fictional company website redesign and redevelopment)
  - This was a UI Design class project that I became very invested in. I completed the requirements for the assessment and passed the class.
