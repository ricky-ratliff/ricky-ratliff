- Hi there, my name is Ricky. I've been working in IT since 2009, but I'm just now getting around to learning some scripting and programming.
- I'm interested in DevOps, SRE, Linux and Windows system administration, cloud and homelab stuff. 
- In the near future, most of my work will be fairly simple as I learn how to do this stuff.
- I can be reached at rratliff5307 at gmail dot com if the mood strikes. 
- Thanks for checking me out, have a good one!
